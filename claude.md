This project is an internship assignment described in the `Technical Assignment_ Semantic Search Challenge.pdf` file.

### Project structure
`frontend/vite-project` contains the React frontend
`backend` contains the search logic and a simple FastAPI server that uses it and makes it avalabile to the frontend

### Coding standards
I want clear, self-explanatory variable names, comments on critical parts of the code, and overall clean code. I want it to be readable.
